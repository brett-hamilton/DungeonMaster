# Dungeon Master
Software Engineering I Team Project - Summer 2021

## Overview
For our SE1 team project, I worked with a six-member team to create a proof-of-concept 2D Dungeons & Dragons style game. Due to the scope of the project, our team chose 
the combat pillar of RPG games to work on (out of the three pillars combat, exploration, and interaction). Using Visual Studio, C# ASP.NET, and Blazor, we were able to 
create a working proof-of-concept for the combat system in a web app interface. A major focus of the course was to learn and practice Agile methodologies in a Scrum team environment. One 
example of the Agile methodologies we experienced was test-driven-development (TDD). We implemented TDD using the Xunit framework. In the final iteration (sprint), we 
created documentation for the progress we made during the semester.
